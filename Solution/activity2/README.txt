This was an in-class activity, to create a page
getting as close to the example page (a colorful table)
as possible in the 25 minutes allotted.
The bingo card has a lot going on in it, so it's not possible
to get everything done in that time, but there are a few themes
that I wanted to highlight:

* multiple classes per div
   The border cells have some characteristics in common,
   the diagonals have some characteristics in common,
   etc.  Those commonalities can be encoded using classes,
   so that a particular cell (possibly both a border and
   a diagonal cell) will belong to both classes and thus
   have both stylings

* box model
   This example shows some border and margin variety,
   since styling is still fairly new.

* CSS in a separate file

The content of the bingo card itself is unimportant,
though I realize I should mention the Gem Show and
maybe the Loft Film Festival, as important parts of
the Tucson experience.
